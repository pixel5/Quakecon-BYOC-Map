# Quakecon-BYOC-Map
Drupal Module for Quakecon BYOC Map generation (2015)

This was a fun weekend project that I converted to use objects for the seats. I am just a beginner in the world of object oriented PHP, so this is me testing the waters with the very tips of my toes. 

No, i'm not going to show anyone how i'm getting the data from the quakecon registration site. Not that it's a well-kept secret, but I see no reason to make it easily accessible. Let's not upset the good people that run that website :D

This is a Drupal Module (written for Drupal 7). I like to do everything completely custom when it comes to D7 modules, so i'm sure someone is going to say "YOU SHOULD HAVE USED VIEWS/ENTITIES/CONTENTTYPES/AHUEAHUEHAUE". You can't tell me what to do. Nerd.
